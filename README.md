# School Scripts

A growing collection of bite-sized utilities for common school automation tasks, arranged as standalone scripts you can drop into any workflow.

## Scripts

- [`D2L_Downloader.user.js`](D2L_Downloader.user.js) — A browser userscript (Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey/Greasemonkey) that adds a floating "Download All Files" pill to BCIT D2L content pages so you can grab allowed documents in one click.
- [`RBC_Transaction_Exporter.user.js`](RBC_Transaction_Exporter.user.js) — A browser userscript (Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey/Greasemonkey) that adds a floating a export all button, to export RBC Transactions into CSV instead of standard PDF
- [`Teams_No_Idle.ps1`](Teams_No_Idle.ps1) — A PowerShell console tool for Windows that juggles the mouse or presses F15 with a lightweight TUI to keep Teams (or similar apps) from going idle.

Scripts are intentionally simple, grouped by platform/stack (e.g., userscripts for browsers, PowerShell for Windows), and the repository will keep growing as new helpers emerge.
